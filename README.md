# 3D Programming
This course introduced the concepts and theory of a modern photorealistic rendering. Through the ideas and software in this course, the students will learn to design and develop a rendering system for creating stunning imagery.

- Turner Whitted Ray Tracing algorithm
- Anti-aliasing based on the Monte Carlo Sampling method
- Soft shadows using an area of light with a set of N light source points and the random
method 
- Depth of field effect where the lens is simulated by a random distribution of N samples on
unit squares or unit disks
- Local color component (Blinn-Phong model illumination)
- Multiple source lights
- Hard Shadows
- Global color component by implementing the mirror reflection and
refraction
